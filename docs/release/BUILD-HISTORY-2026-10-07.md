# Historical eRev build record

Archived from PROGRESS.md on October 7, 2026 to keep the active handoff concise. All dates,
claims and evidence below retain their original meaning; this archive is not a fresh verification.

## Status (historical release record)
- RELEASE CANDIDATE OF 1.0 DECLARED 2026-10-03 (ruling R-127; D-100): the production-readiness programme resumed on 2026-09-29 on Ray's instruction (D-99) ends with it. Record: `docs/reviews/loop/prod/RESUME-2026-09-29.md` (state, lanes, gate measurements; §6 items 40 to 43 are what is Ray's now). Stated limits of the release: `docs/release/LIMITS-1.0.md`. The plan of 2026-09-19 (`docs/reviews/loop/prod/`) is the historical record; brief `~/Plaid FinOps/eRev ASC 606 Review/PRODUCTION-CONTINUATION-20260919.md`.
- Main: the release candidate `f8e46e54` (2026-10-03 21:40 PDT, written 21:41) and, behind it, document commits only (the QA record, a row of the limits document, this record, ruling R-127, D-100; on 10-04 the screenshots (`docs/screenshots/`), `docs/guides/illustrated-guide.md` and, from its check against the screens, five sentences of the user guide and limits rows B3-12, B4-12, B6-8 and one of B.9). Release 1.0 = the product as built at the freeze `4832c645` with register indexes 308 (policy overrides withdrawn) and 309 (a product or a template cannot state three policy values that the books read for a contract alone; four that no rule reads stay a stated limit), decided under Ray's delegation of 10-03 (R-126). On `f8e46e54`: whole backend suite with exactly the standing 15 not passed twice, by name; vitest 2,034 and `make e2e` 189 of 189; lane WEB-QA's QA pass of record; images, compose bring-up, ZAP baseline, dependency audit, `terraform validate`, the restore drill, parity and thorough properties pass; `make answer-keys` (six standing keys), `make test-pg` (three capture witnesses) and `make controls-report` (46 of 49 controls) FAIL by standing causes; `make ci` and `make perf` not run — the release manifest is NON-STRICT ("not release acceptance"). Alembic head 0128 (chain … 0129, 0124, 0128); install on a new database. Rulings R-1 to R-127 (`docs/reviews/loop/prod/RULINGS-2026-09-29.md`). Record §5a holds every gate measurement.
- Nothing is deployed or published. On Ray's order of 10-04 main is pushed to one private repository of his, and nowhere else. The release gate is not an accounting sign-off. BEFORE PRODUCTION USE, not the programme's to close (limits document, class A): the independent revenue-accountant review (G12; package `docs/accounting/reviews/G12-REVIEW-PACKAGE-2026-09-30.md` with its addendum of 2026-10-01; the later candidates are in the rulings log), the hosted inputs UI-1 to UI-14, performance at volume.

## In flight
- Lanes (`.run/sup2/`: `lanes/`, `assignments.md`, `reports/`): nothing assigned; every lane stands by or has ended (ENG-FX l19, QA-BE w2 and ACCT l14 ended on 10-03; SECFIX-IMP w12 stopped). The next release's order is the limits document's class C.
- Known engine open items: three strict expected failures stand (limits document, behind the fifteen names): the sandbox-side close replay (SNP-2b; R-10), the historical basis's line cutoff (PLAN-SUMMARY candidate 113) and the Q-11 observation for the reviewer (AD-33). The earlier items of this line are closed: the ledger line's subject key by index 248, ENG-S14R10-FX-SIGN-1 by R-44 (a), CLO-LOCK-ORDER-1 by R-6.

## Next
- Sequence (D-99 (7), D-100): the release candidate is declared. Next, by Ray: the accountant's review (G12), the hosted inputs and the hosted evidence, performance at volume, any reversal of a decision of R-126; then the next release in the order of `docs/release/LIMITS-1.0.md` class C. No live provisioning, remote push or publication without Ray's explicit authorisation at that step.
- Backlog measured 2026-09-29 by named acceptance tests present on main (`.run/sup2/spec_scan.py`; 431 items): unbuilt or partly built — WEB-16, WEB-24, CTR-6, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 24, 25, 27, 28, DIN-13, 14, 18, CLO-12, 14 to 22, 24, 25, 27, RPS-8 to 16, 18 to 22, SNP-3 to 5, LMG-1 to 11, PRP-1 to 3, FCS-1 to 8, AIX-1 to 12, SOP-3, 5, 6, DMO-1 to 34, PRF-2, 6, DEP-6 to 8, and the phase checkpoints.
- Accounting: VC-CHK-113 and AD-1 to AD-40, with the later candidates, go to the independent accountant with the G12 package; supervisor rulings stay labelled as such.
- Gate timings on a quiet machine (0104e86): ci 38 min; test-pg 1; properties 2 (ci profile; thorough about 70); parity 1; keys 1 each; screens e2e 6; avenmoor-serial 5. Under load batch #9's ci took 105 min. DB gates one at a time per database.

## Spec questions
- SPEC-Q-114 to 195 (PLF-1 to PLF-30): archived verbatim in `docs/reviews/loop/spec-questions-PLF.md` (193 during PLF-30; 194 and 195 at GATE-PLF).
- SPEC-Q-196 to 243 (WEB-1 to WEB-6): archived verbatim in `docs/reviews/loop/spec-questions-WEB.md` (196 to 226 during WEB-4, 227 to 243 during WEB-7) to keep this file under 20 KB; SPEC-Q-244 onward stay here until GATE-WEB.
- SPEC-Q-244 (WEB-7; DG-FE-08 "money strings are never converted to JavaScript numbers" vs DS-CMP-14 Recharts plots, which need numbers): `chartKit.plotNumber` converts a copy of an API string only for pixel geometry (bar heights, the bridge's running level, sparkline coordinates); every displayed figure, tooltip, table cell, summary and label is the API string through the format module, and low and high are chosen with the digit comparison `compareDecimal`. Totals come from the API (`totals`, row `total`), never summed in the browser.
- SPEC-Q-245 (WEB-7 small choices and copy no document fixes): DS-CH-02 uses Recharts range bars (`[low, high]`) instead of a transparent base series (same geometry); the Awaiting trigger column is separated by the band gap and a dashed rule, not an exact 16 px gap; a waterfall with an open period uses a 24 px top margin for the "Open" caption; 36 columns (DS-CH-01) and 12 rows (DS-CH-03) throw in development and tests, because paging and folding into "Other" need API figures; granularity and range paging are screen `controls`; the RPO chart of horizontal bars draws vertical value gridlines; Enter on an RPO row drills with `band: null` (every band); `ratioAboveOne` moved to `charts/ProportionBar.tsx`, which KpiStrip now renders (re-exported for its tests); `recharts ^3.1.0` locked at 3.10.1 (licence-check 0 findings). Copy: "View", "Chart", "Table", "The chart could not be loaded.", "No figures for this range.", "Amount", "Pending triggers", "Balance", "Increase", "Decrease", "Category", "Period", "Total", "{title} from {from} {opening} to {to} {closing}.", "Remaining performance obligations for {row}: {bands}; total {total}.", "No revenue for {scope} in this range."; RPO band column headers join label and code in code (DS-I18N-06). WEB-24 captures the charts in both themes (BS1-D-33).

## Supervisor verification needed
- Browser QA notes from the L6 captures (post-rc unless a lane touches the screen): SF-11 master rows truncate both over-delivery items to an identical "BG-AVM-000..."; SF-12:request shows the "Is active" row of a newly added role as a removal (No → —).
- D-81 (400257d, iteration 70): sprint lanes in worktrees `~/dev/erev-wt/<lane>` with records `docs/reviews/loop/sprint/<lane>.md`; `docs/build-spec/sprint/plan.json` was absent, so this serial loop kept BUILD_SPEC order and ticked WEB-7 here (the merge reconciles `frontend/src/components/charts/`).
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make audit-deps (measured on the release candidate `f8e46e54` 2026-10-03: OK, python 0 in 77 of 77 pinned, npm 0; re-run at every release candidate).
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make compose-verify (measured on the release candidate `f8e46e54` 2026-10-03: OK — readyz at once, CSP present, worker healthy; needs a Docker daemon; compose project `erev-verify` — never two runs at once).
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make zap-baseline (measured on the release candidate `f8e46e54` 2026-10-03: OK, 0 fail / high / medium, 1 low, 3 informational; 05 SAR-43).
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make backup, make restore-verify (measured on the release candidate `f8e46e54` 2026-10-03 through `make restore-drill`: verified — 12 stages, eight workspaces, 693 tables, 306 files, 11 anchors; the clone holds two rows more, the restore's own security events; the native backup and restore rehearsed on a throwaway compose PostgreSQL, project `erev-verify-drill` — never the dev or shared server, which must not receive the BYPASSRLS roles `EREV_BACKUP_URL` / `EREV_RESTORE_ADMIN_URL` need).
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make tf-validate (measured on the release candidate `f8e46e54` 2026-10-03: OK; it fails where the checkout's path makes the gate's temporary directory longer than 86 characters — limits document, row B8-15; init -backend=false, fmt -check, validate only — never plan or apply).
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make docker-build (measured on the release candidate `f8e46e54` 2026-10-03: OK, three images `:f8e46e542cf6` with the embedded manifest read back).
- Supervisor-verified 2026-09-13 (`docs/reviews/loop/supervisor-verification.md`): licence allow-list entries (SPEC-Q-63, 163).
- `GcpSecretManagerStore`, `GcpKeyProvider` (FND-4) are only mypy-checked; verify against GCP before hosted use (SPEC-Q-15, 16).
- Webhook client (PLF-24, SPEC-Q-189): TLS through the httpx `sni_hostname` extension is exercised only with `httpx.MockTransport`; verify one delivery to a real https receiver before hosted use.
- OIDC sign-in (PLF-27, SPEC-Q-192) is exercised only against the mock IdP; before hosted use verify one https sign-in with a real provider, including a confidential client secret through `client_secret_ref`.
- Stranded-task recovery (WEB-3c, SPEC-Q-220) is exercised with simulated Procrastinate rows; verify once with a real `make worker` killed mid-job.
- L9 merge (§7.4): docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml config --quiet rc 0 at 22d6c6e (unset compose secrets warn only); docker build --no-cache of the three Dockerfiles rc 0 at 22d6c6e (.run/l9/docker/fresh/); multi-role browser QA pass 2 run for maya, priya and marcus, robert measured at the API level (docs/qa/G12-multi-role-qa-2026-09-17.md).
- L9 round B (§7.4): docker build --no-cache of the three Dockerfiles at 0104e86 rc 0 (.run/l9b/docker/fresh/; api 051de8c1…, worker ca344e69…, web 35f6028b…); compose config --quiet rc 0; no new browser pass (engine-only changes); robert's rendering owed.
- Launcher ports (WEB-3d, SPEC-Q-226) are exercised with `make -n dev-up` and `proc.sh status` only; verify one `make dev-up` in a review worktree with ports 8192 and 5272.

## Learnings / gotchas
- Merges: `git merge -F -` reads no stdin (message file under `.run/`); join id files with Python, since `cat` of files without a final newline fuses ids. `set -o pipefail` before `| tail`. `make fmt` rewrites files; ruff E501 flags docstrings. zsh: `status` is read-only (`rc=$?`). Never `cd` into the venv.
- Quick tests: `EREV_ENV=test backend/.venv/bin/pytest <paths> -q -p no:cacheprovider --basetemp=.run/pytest`. Never `from conftest import` or `import httpx`/`socket`/`smtplib` in a test (`support.http`, `support.network`). Fixture `PASSWORD` constants need a `scripts/secrets_allowlist.toml` entry.
- Mutation probes: `.run/mutations.py` selected by `EREV_MUTATION` (`PYTHONPATH=.run -p mutations`), patching in `pytest_sessionstart`.
- Gates: `make ci` (about 4 min) then `make test-pg` (about 1 min; never together), foreground with timeout 600000; logs `.run/<gate>-<item>.log`. Regenerate through `make registry-seed|openapi|tokens|fixtures`. New dependency: pyproject + `make setup LOCK=1`.
- DB: FORCE RLS binds `erev_owner` too; column grants refuse unlisted columns (42501); `WITH CHECK` runs after BEFORE triggers; no `%` in `text()` SQL. Config versions: tenant sessions insert DRAFT only; non-DRAFT probes use `platform_session("provisioning")` plus `set_tenant_context`.
- New revision: head id and function count in `test_migrations.py`, `schema_revision` in `tests/api/test_me.py`; `ROW_BUILDERS`; IM-S tables need `TRANSITIONS` and its tests. A changed function body keeps the older revision's body as its own constant.
- Routes: `route_class=GuardedRoute`; `Depends(command("<perm>"))`, `run_command(cmd, deps, fn)`. Domain never imports `api.*`/`adapters/*`; `create_app` stays database-free. `identity_session` only in `auth/**`, `api/v1/health.py`, `db/lint.py`.
- Tenants: provisioned tenants hold `tenant_admin` for the admin; settings through `registry.resolve.setting`, published with `support.rows.publish_registry_version`. ROLE_CHANGE `on_approved` reads the stored preview (`preview.store_preview`).
- Jobs: tests act as the worker (Procrastinate row `doing`, then `run_job`); sweeps cover every tenant, so assert own rows; `run_job` swallows handler assertions.
- Identity: secrets-check flags `TOKEN`/`SECRET` constants of 8+ characters. The next TOTP code is `time_step(now) + 1`. `security_event.occurred_at` and touch-trigger `updated_at` use the database clock.
- Frontend: DOM suites start with `// @vitest-environment jsdom` and call `cleanup()`. openapi-fetch gets `fetch: (r) => globalThis.fetch(r)`; fake timers need `notifyManager.setScheduler(queueMicrotask)`. Icons only through `components/icons/registry`. ESLint `--max-warnings 0`: key handlers on non-interactive elements go in an effect listener; `tabIndex={-1}` on `menu`/`option`/`listbox`/`tablist` containers. Never write the date 2025-12-31 or the word "premium" under frontend/src or backend, tests included (REQ-SEC-009 scan). U+00A0/U+202F need `\u` escapes. Date math lives in `lib/format`.
- Frontend checks from the repo root: `frontend/node_modules/.bin/tsc -b frontend`; `eslint --config frontend/eslint.config.js --max-warnings 0 <paths>`; vitest from `frontend/`. Catalogue messages need letters outside placeholders (DS-I18N-06 pseudo test). jsdom: no PointerEvent (`vi.stubGlobal("PointerEvent", MouseEvent)`), Node's `localStorage` shadows jsdom's (define an in-memory Storage on `window`), zero layout sizes; accessible names join adjacent spans without spaces (add `{" "}`).
- Virtual lists in jsdom: `installGridViewport()` (`src/test/layout.ts`) gives `role=grid` and `[data-virtual-viewport]` 720 px; `scrollToIndex` also needs `Element.scrollTo`, `clientHeight` and `scrollHeight` stubs. `f.*`, `sort` and `view` writes go through `withParams` raw pairs (URLSearchParams encodes `:` and `,`). `test_design_check.py` fails on any design-check warning (off-scale spacing such as `ps-7`) although `make lint` passes. zsh does not word-split `$VAR` path lists.
- Supervisor gates (L8): never run `make parity` beside a database-backed pytest (pg_advisory_lock timeouts error every case); macOS has no GNU `timeout`; a standalone `ruff check` from the repo root misreads first-party imports (use `make lint`); the next e2e run overwrites `.run/reports/e2e/report.json` and `frontend/e2e/.results`, so copy them first. (L9) chrome-devtools get_network_request on a 202 response can hang and wedge the MCP session for the rest of the session; read creation headers from the resulting URL run id (or curl) instead, and keep QA evidence in .run/l9/qa/ as you go. Commands need an Idempotency-Key header (API-C-04) and the Origin header when driven by curl. The request detail route is /approvals/requests/<uuid>, not the request number.
- Shared Postgres and the selection file (L9 round B): two lanes migrating the shared Postgres concurrently exhaust `max_locks_per_transaction` (`out of shared memory`); DB gates serialize through the gate slots (one PID per slot file). `docs/reviews/loop/sprint/rg-selection.txt` is ONE comma-separated line; append ids with a comma, never a new line (fc9b1ed → e6a0f28).
- Lane merges (L9 round B): the corpus-pin tests conflict at every lane merge and pins both lanes moved identically auto-merge one short — recompute the merged pins (234 + Σ new keys); a lane wait loop that pipes `pgrep -f` output through a pathname exclusion never excludes (resolve the PID cwd with lsof).
- Resumed programme (2026-09-30): a stale git-ignored `release-manifest.json` in a checkout (left by `make docker-build` / `compose-verify` before the schema head moved) fails every test that boots the app lifespan with "the release manifest names another schema revision" — delete it. The shared PostgreSQL lock table (6,400 entries, mostly held by other projects' suites) surfaces as SQLSTATE 53200, as HTTP 500s, as failed jobs and as missing columns after a migration-walk test died mid-walk: re-run before diagnosing (`.run/sup2/verify.py`). Conflict markers quoted inside prose broke the revision-union resolver until it matched markers at line start only.
- Supervising named lanes (2026-09-30): a lane's messages are NOT reliably delivered to an idle supervisor (85 lost for three hours) and a supervisor's message reaches a lane only when its turn ends — run `.run/sup2/inbox_watch.py` under a monitor and tell lanes to read their inbox file; a lane session's permission system may refuse `git merge main` or edits of shared test support — never take the refused step over, integrate the branch as it stands. Two lanes took the same build-spec fragment revision: every number comes from the register.


# Earlier October 7 continuation entries

## Validated policy override API — October 7, 2026

- PR #3 merged into public main (`6bca309`). Work continues on
  `codex/policy-override-authoring` from that merge.
- Enabled public draft creation for POL-122 (`balance.right_to_consideration`) at obligation scope
  and POL-047 (`sfc.discount_rate_basis`) at contract scope. Validate the registry schema, obligation
  ownership, nonblank rationale, mathematically valid periodic rate, and any linked reviewed
  same-contract judgement before storing a draft. Other policy keys retain the named refusal.
- Submission and approval recheck linked judgement validity. Approval locks group, contract and
  override before superseding the prior approval; creator/editor exclusions from PR #3 apply.
- Regressions use public creation through approval and calculation: POL-122 reclassifies balances
  and an approved successor reverses it; POL-047 reaches a real deferred-payment calculation
  following a reviewed financing assessment, activation and delivery. A successor corrects the
  inception rate and changes transaction price. Validation failures store no draft or approval;
  unsupported keys and entity-permission boundaries remain covered.
- Actual local verification: 304 policy, product-pinning, unit and architecture tests passed.
  All 15 final policy-domain tests passed again after adding entity-permission and valid judgement-link
  assertions. Mypy passed for both source files; Ruff lint/format, OpenAPI staleness and whitespace
  checks passed. Refreshed OpenAPI and generated frontend types. These are targeted checks, not a
  full-backend or production-readiness claim.
- C-2 remains partial: frontend authoring, POL-163 period-scoped exceptions, broader product
  readers and the database answer-key runner remain open. The wider C-3–C-17 backlog remains in
  `docs/release/LIMITS-1.0.md`. Repository completion only: no deployment, provisioning or live
  release certification is part of this work.

## Draft authors excluded from approval — October 7, 2026

- PR #2 was merged into public main (`4eecb0f`). The next work is on
  `codex/approval-author-exclusions`, addressing B1-14 / the authorship part of C-6.
- Approval subjects now exclude their draft's creator and successful content editors in addition
  to the submitter. The shared kernel applies the same exclusions to direct decisions, delegated
  authority, eligibility reads and notifications. SYSTEM writes preserve the human recorded in
  audit `on_behalf_of_id`; denied/failed audit events do not establish authorship.
- Attribution reviewed against each named subject:

  | Subject | Author evidence |
  | --- | --- |
  | Estimate version | Creator plus successful create/update audit actors and represented users |
  | Policy override | Creator plus successful creation audit attribution |
  | Modification | Creator plus successful create/update/classify audit attribution |
  | Manual event / attribute-change submission | Stored submission creator; inline author is also submitter |
  | Direct FX rate version | Creator plus successful version edits; imported versions retain uploader exclusion |
  | Principal/agent proposal | Authored and submitted in one command; request preparer is the proposal author |
  | SSP override proposal | Authored and submitted in one command; request preparer is the proposal author |

- Initial domain verification: 130 tests passed, one existing parity-entry-point skip, across policy
  overrides, FX, FX imports, estimates, modifications, manual events and the approval engine.
  Architecture plus approval-unit suites: 505 passed. After SYSTEM-attribution hardening,
  23 focused domain/product/SSP tests passed, including separate draft authors and submitters,
  delegated decisions and direct-entry FX editors. All 238 approval-unit tests passed again on the
  final source. Mypy passed for both source files; Ruff
  lint/format and whitespace checks passed. This closes B1-14; the other C-6 controls remain open.
- Next: validated policy-override authoring and its real calculation workflows (C-2). No
  independent accounting sign-off or full-backend/CI claim is made by these targeted checks.
- Archived the earlier build-loop record unchanged into
  `docs/release/BUILD-HISTORY-2026-10-07.md`; the active progress file is again below 20 KB.
  Historical evidence remains dated. No deployment or provisioning.

## Repository-only scope and policy calculation continuation — October 7, 2026

- Owner clarified the scope: finish the repository; do not deploy or provision anything. Cloud
  project/domain inputs are not needed for this work. Independent accounting review and operational
  release gates remain documented requirements for an eventual operator, not tasks to perform here.
- Import recovery PR #1 was merged into public main (`a83b1dd`). Work continues on
  `codex/policy-override-calculation` from that merge.
- C-2 calculation foundation: approved contract-pinned overrides now reach bundle assembly as of
  its cutoff, with obligation > contract > product precedence and member isolation. Draft and
  future approvals are excluded; superseded rows support historical cutoffs. Current approval
  wins deterministic timestamp ties in both the resolver API and bundle reader.
- Fixed two pinning hazards: a scoped value is never promoted to a group default on recomputation;
  a shadowed product default is retained as PRODUCT-scope bundle metadata for subsequent product
  pinning. PRODUCT metadata is not a contract lookup candidate and is not a group policy pin.
- A PostgreSQL regression uses the real submit/approve/compute/persist path: POL-122 changes earned
  unbilled balances from contract assets to receivables without changing their sum; repeated
  computation preserves scope, and an approved successor restores the conditional classification.
  The draft row is seeded by the fixture because public creation remains disabled.
- Actual verification: 50 tests passed across policy domain, product-pin domain/unit, scoped-input
  unit and engine kernel suites; all 267 architecture tests passed. Mypy passed for six changed
  source files; Ruff lint/format and git whitespace checks passed. An additional 346 transaction-price,
  balance-engine and scoped-input tests passed. All checks were local; no cloud services used.
- C-2 remains open: public authoring validation and approval controls, POL-163 period-scoped
  exception handling, a full significant-financing workflow and the platform answer-key runner
  still need completion. This is calculation infrastructure, not a claim that policy overrides

## Continuation — October 7, 2026 (America/Los_Angeles)

- Branch `codex/import-job-recovery`, based on public main `43631fc`. Closed the implementation
  of B5-3 / C-1 on this branch: a failed import commit waits for a competing upload-row lock;
  if cleanup times out or fails, its required failure hook rolls settlement back for the job
  sweeper to retry. Cancelling a queued import commit now ends its upload atomically, releasing
  its source for a fresh upload. A late dispatch cannot commit the cancelled job.
- Added four PostgreSQL regression tests covering held rows, queued cancellation/re-upload,
  cancellation rollback and cleanup-timeout recovery. Both original bug cases reproduced on
  unmodified application source before the fix. Actual verification: 52 tests passed across
  import transient-failure, job domain/API and registry unit suites; the expanded re-upload test
  passed separately. All 267 architecture tests passed. Mypy passed for all four changed source
  files; Ruff lint/format and git whitespace checks passed.
- Tests used a newly initialized, disposable PostgreSQL 17 cluster on localhost port 55437 and
  database `erev_rv_cont`, with separate unprivileged owner/app roles and ignored fresh local keys.
  No existing database, deployment or external provider was used. Dependencies installed from
  the frozen backend lockfile. No schema migration or accounting calculation changes.
- This prevents new stranded commits; it does not bulk-repair historical terminal jobs. All other
  limitations and October 3 test failures remain historical and unresolved unless stated here.
  Full backend/CI, live deployment, accounting review and volume performance were not rerun.
- Next implementation item: C-2, policy overrides that actually reach calculation, including
  POL-122 and the significant-financing rate path. Independent accounting decisions remain reviewer work; hosted inputs are outside the
  owner's clarified repository-only scope. Research folders and removed website references stay excluded.
