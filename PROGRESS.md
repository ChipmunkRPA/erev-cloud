# PROGRESS — eRev Cloud build loop notebook (under 20 KB)

## Policy override workbench — October 7, 2026

- PR #4 merged into public main (`51aa535`). Work continues on `codex/policy-override-ui`.
- The contract workbench now offers Policy overrides to users with entity-scoped `config.read`.
  Authoring additionally requires `contract.create` for the contract's entity. Historical views
  expose no command. Drafts can be authored before activation, including financing rates.
- Added POL-122 obligation/right and POL-047 contract/rate forms. Rates remain decimal strings;
  the screen explains inception rates and corrections. Saving creates a durable draft; submission
  is a separate action on that saved record. Reopening or retrying submission reuses the draft.
  The list displays scope, value, rationale, status and an approval-request link where present.
- Commands invalidate the contract override list along with the existing contract reads. Required
  fields, server refusals, network failures, list retry and read-only access have explicit behavior.
  Existing API validation and independent-approval controls remain authoritative.
- Actual verification: all **2,040 frontend tests across 191 files passed**, including six new drawer
  tests and the 66 workbench tests. TypeScript project build, changed-file ESLint, production frontend
  build, formatting and whitespace checks passed. Design check scanned 499 files with no findings.
  Local Chromium screenshots of both forms were inspected with mocked records and no runtime errors;
  this is UI verification, not live-service or accounting sign-off evidence.
- Remaining C-2: POL-163 period-scoped contract exceptions, broader product readers, database
  answer-key coverage, and an optional reviewed-judgement attachment selector in this drawer (the
  API already accepts and validates that link). Wider outstanding items remain in LIMITS-1.0.md.
  Current scope remains repository completion; no deployment or provisioning.

## Validated policy override API — October 7, 2026

- PR #3 merged into public main (`6bca309`). Work continues on
  `codex/policy-override-authoring` from that merge.
- Enabled public draft creation for POL-122 (`balance.right_to_consideration`) at obligation scope
  and POL-047 (`sfc.discount_rate_basis`) at contract scope. Validate the registry schema, obligation
  ownership, nonblank rationale, mathematically valid periodic rate, and any linked reviewed
  same-contract judgement before storing a draft. Other policy keys retain the named refusal.
- Submission and approval recheck linked judgement validity. Approval locks group, contract and
  override before superseding the prior approval; creator/editor exclusions from PR #3 apply.
- Regressions use public creation through approval and calculation: POL-122 reclassifies balances
  and an approved successor reverses it; POL-047 reaches a real deferred-payment calculation
  following a reviewed financing assessment, activation and delivery. A successor corrects the
  inception rate and changes transaction price. Validation failures store no draft or approval;
  unsupported keys and entity-permission boundaries remain covered.
- Actual local verification: 304 policy, product-pinning, unit and architecture tests passed.
  All 15 final policy-domain tests passed again after adding entity-permission and valid judgement-link
  assertions. Mypy passed for both source files; Ruff lint/format, OpenAPI staleness and whitespace
  checks passed. Refreshed OpenAPI and generated frontend types. These are targeted checks, not a
  full-backend or production-readiness claim.
- C-2 remains partial: frontend authoring, POL-163 period-scoped exceptions, broader product
  readers and the database answer-key runner remain open. The wider C-3–C-17 backlog remains in
  `docs/release/LIMITS-1.0.md`. Repository completion only: no deployment, provisioning or live
  release certification is part of this work.

## Draft authors excluded from approval — October 7, 2026

- PR #2 was merged into public main (`4eecb0f`). The next work is on
  `codex/approval-author-exclusions`, addressing B1-14 / the authorship part of C-6.
- Approval subjects now exclude their draft's creator and successful content editors in addition
  to the submitter. The shared kernel applies the same exclusions to direct decisions, delegated
  authority, eligibility reads and notifications. SYSTEM writes preserve the human recorded in
  audit `on_behalf_of_id`; denied/failed audit events do not establish authorship.
- Attribution reviewed against each named subject:

  | Subject | Author evidence |
  | --- | --- |
  | Estimate version | Creator plus successful create/update audit actors and represented users |
  | Policy override | Creator plus successful creation audit attribution |
  | Modification | Creator plus successful create/update/classify audit attribution |
  | Manual event / attribute-change submission | Stored submission creator; inline author is also submitter |
  | Direct FX rate version | Creator plus successful version edits; imported versions retain uploader exclusion |
  | Principal/agent proposal | Authored and submitted in one command; request preparer is the proposal author |
  | SSP override proposal | Authored and submitted in one command; request preparer is the proposal author |

- Initial domain verification: 130 tests passed, one existing parity-entry-point skip, across policy
  overrides, FX, FX imports, estimates, modifications, manual events and the approval engine.
  Architecture plus approval-unit suites: 505 passed. After SYSTEM-attribution hardening,
  23 focused domain/product/SSP tests passed, including separate draft authors and submitters,
  delegated decisions and direct-entry FX editors. All 238 approval-unit tests passed again on the
  final source. Mypy passed for both source files; Ruff
  lint/format and whitespace checks passed. This closes B1-14; the other C-6 controls remain open.
- Next: validated policy-override authoring and its real calculation workflows (C-2). No
  independent accounting sign-off or full-backend/CI claim is made by these targeted checks.
- Archived the earlier build-loop record unchanged into
  `docs/release/BUILD-HISTORY-2026-10-07.md`; the active progress file is again below 20 KB.
  Historical evidence remains dated. No deployment or provisioning.

## Repository-only scope and policy calculation continuation — October 7, 2026

- Owner clarified the scope: finish the repository; do not deploy or provision anything. Cloud
  project/domain inputs are not needed for this work. Independent accounting review and operational
  release gates remain documented requirements for an eventual operator, not tasks to perform here.
- Import recovery PR #1 was merged into public main (`a83b1dd`). Work continues on
  `codex/policy-override-calculation` from that merge.
- C-2 calculation foundation: approved contract-pinned overrides now reach bundle assembly as of
  its cutoff, with obligation > contract > product precedence and member isolation. Draft and
  future approvals are excluded; superseded rows support historical cutoffs. Current approval
  wins deterministic timestamp ties in both the resolver API and bundle reader.
- Fixed two pinning hazards: a scoped value is never promoted to a group default on recomputation;
  a shadowed product default is retained as PRODUCT-scope bundle metadata for subsequent product
  pinning. PRODUCT metadata is not a contract lookup candidate and is not a group policy pin.
- A PostgreSQL regression uses the real submit/approve/compute/persist path: POL-122 changes earned
  unbilled balances from contract assets to receivables without changing their sum; repeated
  computation preserves scope, and an approved successor restores the conditional classification.
  The draft row is seeded by the fixture because public creation remains disabled.
- Actual verification: 50 tests passed across policy domain, product-pin domain/unit, scoped-input
  unit and engine kernel suites; all 267 architecture tests passed. Mypy passed for six changed
  source files; Ruff lint/format and git whitespace checks passed. An additional 346 transaction-price,
  balance-engine and scoped-input tests passed. All checks were local; no cloud services used.
- C-2 remains open: public authoring validation and approval controls, POL-163 period-scoped
  exception handling, a full significant-financing workflow and the platform answer-key runner
  still need completion. This is calculation infrastructure, not a claim that policy overrides
  are available in the UI or that the repository is production-ready. No deployment performed.

## Continuation — October 7, 2026 (America/Los_Angeles)

- Branch `codex/import-job-recovery`, based on public main `43631fc`. Closed the implementation
  of B5-3 / C-1 on this branch: a failed import commit waits for a competing upload-row lock;
  if cleanup times out or fails, its required failure hook rolls settlement back for the job
  sweeper to retry. Cancelling a queued import commit now ends its upload atomically, releasing
  its source for a fresh upload. A late dispatch cannot commit the cancelled job.
- Added four PostgreSQL regression tests covering held rows, queued cancellation/re-upload,
  cancellation rollback and cleanup-timeout recovery. Both original bug cases reproduced on
  unmodified application source before the fix. Actual verification: 52 tests passed across
  import transient-failure, job domain/API and registry unit suites; the expanded re-upload test
  passed separately. All 267 architecture tests passed. Mypy passed for all four changed source
  files; Ruff lint/format and git whitespace checks passed.
- Tests used a newly initialized, disposable PostgreSQL 17 cluster on localhost port 55437 and
  database `erev_rv_cont`, with separate unprivileged owner/app roles and ignored fresh local keys.
  No existing database, deployment or external provider was used. Dependencies installed from
  the frozen backend lockfile. No schema migration or accounting calculation changes.
- This prevents new stranded commits; it does not bulk-repair historical terminal jobs. All other
  limitations and October 3 test failures remain historical and unresolved unless stated here.
  Full backend/CI, live deployment, accounting review and volume performance were not rerun.
- Next implementation item: C-2, policy overrides that actually reach calculation, including
  POL-122 and the significant-financing rate path. Independent accounting decisions remain reviewer work; hosted inputs are outside the
  owner's clarified repository-only scope. Research folders and removed website references stay excluded.

## Public repository publication — October 5, 2026 (America/Los_Angeles)

- Owner requested public publication with commercial use prohibited. Prepared the supplied directory
  snapshot for `https://github.com/ChipmunkRPA/erev-cloud`, using PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.
- Updated LICENSE, NOTICE, bundled web copies, Python/npm package metadata, README and About dialog.
  Third-party notices remain intact. Previously granted MIT rights are not revoked.
- Excluded the entire `research-harness/` and `docs/research/` directories at the owner's explicit request; retained application
  source, fixtures, screenshots and documentation. See `docs/release/PUBLICATION-2026-10-05.md`.
- Actual validation: locked `npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`; AboutDialog vitest 4/4 passed;
  frontend Vite production build passed (existing large-chunk warning). `python3 scripts/secrets_check.py`:
  4,053 files scanned, 8 allow-listed, zero findings and zero unused entries before this note.
- Additional redacted Gitleaks scan reviewed: test constants, placeholder JWT, accounting identifiers
  and historical test references; research-harness findings removed with the entire directory.
  Targeted credential-pattern scan found only intentional self-test fixtures. These are targeted
  publication checks, not a full security audit. No generated dependencies or real environment/state
  files are staged.
- Backend/integration/accounting suites were not rerun for this licensing/publication change. Earlier
  results below remain historical. No deployment or cloud mutation; production/accounting blockers
  in LIMITS-1.0.md remain. Publication supersedes the earlier private-only instruction in this notebook.

### Publication correction — October 5, 2026

- Removed the entire research-harness and docs/research directories from the publication and replaced the initial root
  commit, so main has no ancestor containing those files. Used an exact force-with-lease against the
  previously verified remote commit. No application code changed; application tests were not rerun
  for this directory removal. External clones and GitHub cached/unreachable objects cannot be recalled
  by a branch rewrite alone.

### Public report website cleanup — October 5, 2026

- Scanned the repository for website references and reviewed documentation matches. Removed 155
  external website URLs plus bare domains across 12 documents and removed the design source
  bibliography. Kept explicit citation-removal markers, mandatory third-party notices, dependency
  metadata and operational endpoints. This does not revalidate the remaining historical prose.
- Follow-up documentation URL scan found only owner links, internal/example addresses and a local
  URL-validation regex. `git diff --check` passed. No application source changed; no application
  tests rerun. Replaced the public root with an exact force-with-lease against the verified head.
