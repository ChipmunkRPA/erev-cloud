# PROGRESS — eRev Cloud build loop notebook (under 20 KB)

**Owner workflow: test, then commit and push directly to main. Create no new PRs unless branch protection requires one. No deployment.**

## CSV progress and event field reconciliation — October 7, 2026

- Continued from clean main 31e2d1b. Prior turn published legacy modification checks and
  identified additional CSV gaps (progress). Extended the shared event reader to compare
  explicit numeric and identity fields from original validated rows, using wide decimals.
- CSV progress now checks all four event kinds: delivery, return, progress and milestone.
  Reconciles refund amount/currency (absent versus zero), quantity, progress ratio, hours,
  milestone weight/code, obligation, trigger/measure, references, contract/date/source identity.
  The expected event kind is taken from the source row, not the emitter's modified body.
- Usage now also checks quantity, period dates, metric and obligation. Cost/pre-standard
  events bind their obligation; costs also compare purpose, flags, payee and plan. Source
  amounts continue to reconcile to stored events before verified file-column totals are kept.
- Original monetary regression module: **15 passed in 55.28 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/csv-event-fields-first.log. Expanded progress/refund and event-field tests,
  CSV template workflows and layer/import-cycle checks: **95 passed in 180.38 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/csv-event-fields-final.log. Changed refunds, quantities, ratios, hours, weights,
  wrong obligations and missing event targets all roll back without source/event/lineage or
  calculation children. Null/zero refund and rated-usage cases retain their distinction.
  All runs terminal. Source Mypy, Ruff lint/format and whitespace pass; no full backend claim.
- Updated the coverage inventory, B1-19 and developer guidance; preserved older setup
  evidence in build history. Next: FX rates, bundle quantities and CSV invoice quantity/
  contract/obligation checks. Integration-owner fallback, AI, other implementation and
  verification gaps and independent accounting sign-off remain open. No deployment.
  Publication exclusions/noncommercial licensing are unchanged.

## Legacy modification reconciliation and coverage audit — October 7, 2026

- Continued from clean main 35c9fe2. Prior turn published legacy progress checks (progress).
  Added independent amendment read-back for signed consideration and quantity deltas,
  line identities/dates, all-obligation treatment, approved SSP reference and override defaults.
  Also checks source/approval/synthetic modification identity, emitted targets and added
  obligation product identities. Expected facts do not reuse emitter line/catalogue builders.
- Prospective, retrospective, price-only, negative and add-obligation workflows are covered
  by new tests. Faults injected after approval alter amount, quantity, treatment, SSP basis
  or the added obligation's stored product. Mismatches must roll back the whole import.
- Initial replay: **3 passed, 6 failed in 124.28 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/legacy-modification-first.log. The new expectation omitted default SSP
  is_override/justification fields; corrected the comparison. Expanded replay, matrix and
  layer/import-cycle run: **63 passed, 3 failed in 216.60 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/legacy-modification-final.log. The three new add-obligation fixtures omitted
  required account fields, so validation refused them before the gate. Completed those rows;
  corrected matrix rerun: **10 passed in 66.40 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/legacy-modification-corrected.log. All runs terminal. Source Mypy,
  Ruff lint/format and whitespace pass.
- Audited the actual emitter registry and callback bodies. Added dated coverage inventory
  docs/release/IMPORT-RECONCILIATION-2026-10-07.md; a callback's presence is not full coverage.
  Remaining: CSV progress refund/numeric inputs, FX rates, bundle quantities, invoice/usage
  quantities and explicit event obligation binding. CSV modifications have no emitter and
  remain explicitly refused; legacy support does not imply CSV support.
- Updated B1-19/developer guidance and preserved old SSP evidence in build history. Next:
  close the named CSV gaps. Other implementation/verification gaps, integration-owner fallback,
  AI and independent accounting sign-off remain open. No whole-backend/readiness claim or
  deployment. Publication exclusions/noncommercial licensing are unchanged.

## Legacy progress monetary reconciliation — October 7, 2026

- Continued from clean main f15e790. The prior turn published legacy setup checks (progress).
  Added independent read-back for legacy progress imports, including the original aggregated
  rows. Source billing, signed pre-standard revenue and delivery are summed by obligation/SKU
  without reusing the emitter's aggregation or payload builder.
- Compares stored billing/credit/revenue and delivery/return events, their currency/date,
  lead source-record identity and declared targets. Independently checks signed synthetic
  invoice/credit headers and lines, including currency, source identity, product and obligation.
  Positive billing must link to the expected invoice. Zero aggregates create neither a
  financial event nor a document. Verified file-column totals retain their original semantics.
- Tests inject changed event amount, changed signed invoice amount, changed revenue/quantity,
  a missing event and an unexpected posting for a zero aggregate after approval. Every mismatch
  rolls back the complete import, preserving existing contracts, events and invoices and leaving
  no source records or lineage. Positive, negative and zero duplicate-row aggregates succeed.
- Existing progress/credit/return workflows: **11 passed in 86.83 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/legacy-progress-first.log. New matrix, amended-terms and layer/import-cycle
  checks: **59 passed in 100.96 seconds**, /private/tmp/legacy-progress-final.log.
  Final reader uses copy_abs to preserve full decimal precision; matrix rerun: **11 passed
  in 72.55 seconds**, /private/tmp/legacy-progress-verified.log. All runs terminal.
  Source Mypy, Ruff lint/format and whitespace pass. No whole-backend or readiness claim.
- Updated B1-19 and developer guidance; preserved dated estimate evidence in build history.
  Next: legacy modification monetary read-back. Integration-owner fallback, AI, other
  implementation/verification gaps and independent accounting sign-off remain open.
  No deployment. Publication exclusions/noncommercial licensing are unchanged.

## Zero-posting late-event register — October 7, 2026

- Continued from 3705c7c. The previous turn confirmed no open PRs and main as the sole
  remote branch; it made no implementation change. Implemented REG-LATE-NOLINE-1 using
  stored ENGINE LATE_EVENT findings, joined to actual event UUIDs through their dedupe keys.
  New fallback findings pin the primary book. Legacy findings retain the stated primary-book
  fallback; secondary books require their own stored evidence.
- Findings are filtered by entity, book, calendar/period and both finding/event timestamps.
  Closed/resolved status does not erase inclusion evidence. Existing single/cumulative ledger
  attributions suppress additional event rows for the same origin/posting pair. Zero rows do
  not invent ledger lines or effects. Event amount is the explicit payload Money value for a
  single event; it is null for multi-event sets, triggers or events with no explicit amount.
  Column labels explicitly identify revenue/balance amounts posted out of period. Catalogue
  and source-binding declarations name the additional inputs.
- K07 now drives the actual queued import computation. Before that worker, no row is shown;
  after it, the EUR 100,000 invoice is shown with zero effects/line count, uploader and import
  approval. Checks include timestamps immediately before/at finding creation, other periods,
  origin filters and another book. Existing cumulative-attribution and frozen-register tests
  retain their original counts and monetary expectations. CSV keeps event amounts separate.
- Final register/export/provenance/snapshot/source-binding run: **110 passed in 71.39 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/late-register-final.log. Intermediate runs identified missing ReportParams in
  the new test and updated CSV header expectations; both are corrected. Source Mypy and Ruff
  pass. Import-cycle/layer/report-reader architecture checks: **49 passed in 8.86 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/late-register-architecture.log. All runs terminal; no complete backend pass claimed.
- LIMITS B4-7/B3-7 and standing K07 failure are updated. Prior-date balance classification and
  broader secondary-book finding coverage remain limited. One original baseline failure
  remains: the absent AI lifecycle feature. Monetary import reconciliation, other documented
  gaps, full current verification and independent accounting sign-off remain outstanding.
  No deployment. Publication exclusions and PolyForm Noncommercial licensing are unchanged.

## Outstanding release verification

These checks need current release-candidate evidence. Historical October 3 results
remain in the dated build history; they do not verify current main. This list does
not authorize deployment, provisioning or changes to a live database.

- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make audit-deps
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make docker-build
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make compose-verify
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make zap-baseline
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make tf-validate (validation only)
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make backup, make restore-verify (isolated local drill only)

## Older backend baseline completed — October 7, 2026

- PID 36126 is terminal and absent. The uninterrupted isolated run on revision 7c9b22d
  ended with **51 failed, 9,970 passed, 1 skipped, 640 deselected, 3 xfailed in 3h46m**.
  See docs/release/BACKEND-BASELINE-2026-10-07.md for the complete failure inventory and
  local evidence paths. No reset/restart occurred. This older run does not verify current main.
- Next: compare failures with current code, rerun scoped cases, and classify from evidence.
  Monetary import reconciliation and independent accounting sign-off remain outstanding.

## Policy approvals serialized with period locks — October 7, 2026

- Continued from PR #8 on main (`9c5556f`). Policy overrides do not append a contract event,
  so the existing event-appender period pin did not protect their approvals.
- Approval of an override on a non-draft contract now shares the close-window rows of all
  contracting/performing entities under tenant scope, after taking the group/contract locks and
  before publishing approval or supersession. Draft contracts have no frozen calculation and skip
  this control. The new scope entry is explicit in the architecture allowlist and developer guide.
- The pending-approvals gate ordinarily prevents a lock while a policy decision is outstanding.
  The regression uses the real **approved waiver** of that gate to exercise the permitted close
  path. When policy approval comes first, the lock waits, then refuses the committed dirty group.
  When the lock comes first, a later approval waits and can commit after it. When a lock overtakes
  an already-started policy decision, the stale approval is refused with `PERIOD_STATE_MOVED`;
  no approval audit or dirty mark is kept, the override remains submitted, and a retry succeeds.
- Counterfactual verification in an isolated test process bypassed only the new check: the stale
  policy decision returned **200 APPROVED** after the newer lock, where the regression requires
  409. With the check enabled, all three real PostgreSQL race cases passed. An earlier observation
  without a waiver proved lack of waiting but the ordinary pending gate still prevented locking;
  it is not evidence of a completed inconsistent lock.
- Actual verification: **26 policy and PostgreSQL window/race tests passed**, including the three
  new cases; **267 architecture tests passed**. Mypy passed both changed source files; Ruff
  lint/format and whitespace checks passed. These are targeted checks, not full-backend evidence.
- The economic treatment of FX classification transitions remains pending independent accounting
  review; public POL-163 authoring stays disabled. Repository completion only; no deployment.

## FX transition refusal and close-policy inputs — October 7, 2026

- PR #7 merged into main (`dc1c116`). Current work continues from that revision; no deployment.
- Added the missing functional-layer validation before a calculation can emit output. A fully
  consumed layer must carry zero; an open historical contract-liability layer must carry its
  remaining original historical basis. Positive and negative residues, partial releases and no
  release all refuse with the layer, period and expected/actual amounts identified.
- The reproduced monetary-to-historical defect is now blocked, **not implemented as a supported
  transition**. A PostgreSQL regression verifies the refused recomputation leaves the previous
  calculation head and journal lines intact and keeps the group dirty. Public POL-163 authoring
  remains disabled pending reviewed transition treatment and remaining approval/close validation.
- Close-run policy digests now include effective contract exceptions through the same period-scoped
  resolver used by bundles, under tenant scope. Drafts, same-value approvals, approvals after the
  entity-local period end and IFRS-forced treatment do not alter the digest. Existing digests are
  unchanged when no exception differs from the entity default.
- A real database close job records the old inputs, an effective approval makes its gate fail,
  and the next close job recomputes and records the new inputs. The prior period remains valid;
  the asset-position fixture needs no monetary adjustment or duplicate journal. Approval/lock
  concurrency still needs focused review; these tests do not certify the whole close workflow.
- Actual verification: **578 FX engine, posting, property and architecture tests passed**;
  **22 database and close-input unit tests passed**. Mypy passed both source files. Ruff lint,
  formatting and whitespace checks passed. No full-backend or production-readiness claim.
- Added `docs/release/ACCOUNTING-REVIEW.md` with the measured case, required decisions about
  correction versus a change in refund rights, economic timing, basis/rates and closed periods,
  and a pending independent-sign-off record. Reviewer identity was requested; no external contact
  or accounting sign-off occurred. This packet is not an approval.
- Earlier continuation entries were moved unchanged to the dated build history to keep this
  notebook below 20 KB. Publication exclusions and PolyForm Noncommercial licensing are retained.

## Public repository publication — October 5, 2026 (America/Los_Angeles)

- Owner requested public publication with commercial use prohibited. Prepared the supplied directory
  snapshot for `https://github.com/ChipmunkRPA/erev-cloud`, using PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.
- Updated LICENSE, NOTICE, bundled web copies, Python/npm package metadata, README and About dialog.
  Third-party notices remain intact. Previously granted MIT rights are not revoked.
- Excluded the entire `research-harness/` and `docs/research/` directories at the owner's explicit request; retained application
  source, fixtures, screenshots and documentation. See `docs/release/PUBLICATION-2026-10-05.md`.
- Actual validation: locked `npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`; AboutDialog vitest 4/4 passed;
  frontend Vite production build passed (existing large-chunk warning). `python3 scripts/secrets_check.py`:
  4,053 files scanned, 8 allow-listed, zero findings and zero unused entries before this note.
- Additional redacted Gitleaks scan reviewed: test constants, placeholder JWT, accounting identifiers
  and historical test references; research-harness findings removed with the entire directory.
  Targeted credential-pattern scan found only intentional self-test fixtures. These are targeted
  publication checks, not a full security audit. No generated dependencies or real environment/state
  files are staged.
- Backend/integration/accounting suites were not rerun for this licensing/publication change. Earlier
  results below remain historical. No deployment or cloud mutation; production/accounting blockers
  in LIMITS-1.0.md remain. Publication supersedes the earlier private-only instruction in this notebook.

### Publication correction — October 5, 2026

- Removed the entire research-harness and docs/research directories from the publication and replaced the initial root
  commit, so main has no ancestor containing those files. Used an exact force-with-lease against the
  previously verified remote commit. No application code changed; application tests were not rerun
  for this directory removal. External clones and GitHub cached/unreachable objects cannot be recalled
  by a branch rewrite alone.

### Public report website cleanup — October 5, 2026

- Scanned the repository for website references and reviewed documentation matches. Removed 155
  external website URLs plus bare domains across 12 documents and removed the design source
  bibliography. Kept explicit citation-removal markers, mandatory third-party notices, dependency
  metadata and operational endpoints. This does not revalidate the remaining historical prose.
- Follow-up documentation URL scan found only owner links, internal/example addresses and a local
  URL-validation regex. `git diff --check` passed. No application source changed; no application
  tests rerun. Replaced the public root with an exact force-with-lease against the verified head.

## Historical release record

The earlier build-loop notebook is preserved in
[BUILD-HISTORY-2026-10-07.md](docs/release/BUILD-HISTORY-2026-10-07.md).
Current outstanding implementation and verification gaps remain in
[the release limitations](docs/release/LIMITS-1.0.md).
