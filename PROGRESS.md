# PROGRESS — eRev Cloud build loop notebook (under 20 KB)

**Owner workflow: test, then commit and push directly to main. Create no new PRs unless branch protection requires one. No deployment.**

## Invitation-erasure identity recheck — October 8, 2026

- Continued from clean published main 4e90c37; previous turn recorded passing full lint.
  Closed B6-5: invitations lock and reread existing identities after locking any reused
  membership, before ending prior membership state, assigning roles or queuing mail. Disabled
  identities, changed normalized email and operator identities are refused. The acting-tenant
  membership-to-identity lock order matches erasure. New memberships also pin/recheck existing
  identities. A later explicit invitation to an erased person's former address may still create
  a separate new identity; the retained erased identity is never revived.
- PostgreSQL counterexample: **1 failed, 11 deselected in 7.71 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/invitation-erasure-baseline.log. A real erasure committed between discovery and
  membership lock; the invitation wrongly returned 201 and revived the erased row as INVITED.
  After repair, privacy/operator-reinvite/acceptance checks: **19 passed, 1 failed in 49.46
  seconds**, /private/tmp/invitation-erasure-fixed.log. Only an old 12-preference expectation
  failed: APPROVAL_UNASSIGNED had made 13. Replaced the count with the explicit expected kinds
  and corrected the stale activation docstring.
- Added erased-identity refusal in another workspace. Expanded privacy/invitation/access-scope
  and membership/person architecture checks: **29 passed in 66.36 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/invitation-erasure-final.log. After normalizing the compared address, focused
  erased/racing/new-identity verification: **3 passed, 10 deselected in 9.67 seconds**,
  /private/tmp/invitation-erasure-verified.log. These database processes are terminal. Source
  Mypy (two files), Ruff lint/format and whitespace checks pass. Tests assert no invitation
  outbox row or invitation audit survives the refusal. No live email was sent.
- Property gate session 52175 / PID 6358 remains live in its original immutable context;
  two metamorphic tests passed so far. Its fixtures were inspected: no database use, so the
  separate PostgreSQL regressions above could run safely; no two database pytest processes
  overlapped. Keep polling that same property process. Updated limitations/developer guide,
  archived prior SSP-routing evidence verbatim. No deployment or readiness claim. Remaining
  implementation/release checks, engine cut/replays and independent sign-off remain open.

## Broader repository checks and reopen UI tests — October 8, 2026

- Continued from clean published main 37c4f0c; previous turn made verified SSP-routing progress.
  `make typecheck` passed all 850 Python source files and frontend TypeScript. `make build`
  passed frontend production bundling and backend imports, with a non-failing large-chunk warning.
- Full frontend suite: **2 failed, 2,055 passed in 55.71 seconds** (192 files). Two old cockpit
  tests expected error corrections without an independently reviewed judgement. Corrected the
  scoped reviewed-evidence mock, citation-required/submitted assertions and reviewer display.
  Preserved optional new judgement/attachment coverage under late-source reopening with its
  exact request payload. No application code changed. Focused checks: **34 passed in 4.96
  seconds**. Full rerun: **2,057 passed in 55.65 seconds**, 192 files. All these processes are
  terminal; Prettier, frontend tsc and whitespace checks pass. Dated log paths/hashes and scope
  are in docs/release/REPOSITORY-CHECKS-2026-10-08.md. This is not a full CI or browser pass.
- Follow-up on clean main 1d59f65: `make lint` passed. Ruff formatting: 2,006 files;
  Ruff, Prettier, ESLint, OpenAPI, registry, migration-head and fixture checks passed. Design:
  501 files / no findings; vocabulary: 1,198 / no findings. Dependency licences: 133 packages,
  no unexpected findings; secrets: 3,423 files, no unexpected findings or unused allowances.
  All 495 control markers are valid (collection only, not a controls-report pass). Log:
  /private/tmp/erev-lint-2026-10-08.log, hash in the dated repository-checks note. Lint process
  is terminal. Confirmed PolyForm Noncommercial licence and no tracked files in either excluded
  research directory. Archived prior SSP-lineage evidence verbatim to preserve notebook size.
- LIVE PROPERTY GATE: executor session **52175**, pytest PID **6358**, immutable context
  .run/gates/ctx-properties-37c4f0c48918-6323. Command `make properties`, thorough profile,
  48 tests collected; two metamorphic tests passed, suite active with increasing CPU time. Log:
  /private/tmp/erev-properties-2026-10-08.log. Preserve and poll this exact process; never restart
  on elapsed time alone. Inspect the final report and bindings before claiming a result. Other
  test/typecheck/build handles are terminal. Inspection confirmed property tests use in-memory worlds and no database fixtures; keep database test processes serial with each other.
- Archived prior journal-validation evidence verbatim. Remaining implementation, current
  release checks, engine cut/replays and independent accounting sign-off remain open. No
  deployment/readiness claim; preserve exclusions and noncommercial licensing; push to main.

## GL reconciliation ledger-history freshness — October 8, 2026

- Continued from clean published main 8579c6b (previous turn made verified progress).
  Closed B2-8: GL reconciliation freshness now watches later seals across ledger history
  through the reconciled period end, matching the comparison's account/role population.
  An earlier-period posting invalidates review even without a reversal into the current period.
  Older rows retain timestamp fallback over the same range. Billing stays period-scoped;
  other entities/books and future periods do not invalidate either comparison.
- First regression run: **8 failed, 25 deselected in 14.32 seconds**, all fixture transition
  calls missing set_values. Corrected baseline: **6 failed, 2 passed, 25 deselected in
  15.23 seconds**: two cases reproduced the missed earlier-period posting; four were fixture
  period-state errors. Corrected fixtures and implementation: **8 passed, 25 deselected in
  13.51 seconds**. Logs: /private/tmp/reconciliation-history-{before,baseline,fixed}.log.
- Added entity isolation and unsigned-cockpit checks. Broader lock/reconciliation and query
  coverage: **48 passed in 142.38 seconds**, /private/tmp/reconciliation-history-expanded.log.
  Strengthened the matrix with amounts moved between distinct accounts: **10 passed,
  25 deselected in 15.82 seconds**, /private/tmp/reconciliation-history-final.log. All processes
  terminal. Ruff lint/format, source Mypy and whitespace checks pass. Existing concurrent
  posting/generation cases remain covered by the broad run. No current full-suite claim.
- Updated the model, B2-8 and developer guidance; archived prior repository-gate evidence
  verbatim. Exact role-balance recomparison (B1-29), volume/release checks, remaining product
  gaps and independent accounting sign-off remain open. No deployment; preserve exclusions
  and noncommercial licensing. Publish tested changes directly to main.

## Durable completeness refusal evidence — October 8, 2026

- Continued from published main c0e4fc6. Failed JE_COMPLETE evaluations now retain CTL-019
  FAIL observations after the refused lock request or approval transaction rolls back. Evidence
  cites the existing period state, so missing journal runs are covered. The original refusal and
  pending approval remain; no period lock or business write survives. Same caller/tenant scope,
  nested refusals retained once, and evidence-write failure rolls back partial observations.
- Migration 0141 adds PERIOD_STATE and refuses downgrade while such evidence exists. Updated
  generated API types, control registry, audit classification and B1-24 guidance. Completed the
  prior currency finding's missing IMP-149 PRD catalogue row and matching architecture counts.
- Initial PostgreSQL cases: **2 passed, 21 deselected in 10.10 seconds**. Expanded lock/UOW/
  validation/all-architecture run: **329 passed, 2 failed in 203.69 seconds**; fixed missing audit
  object classification and currency catalogue drift. Final affected run: **98 passed, 1 failed
  in 85.53 seconds**; only catalogue row count remained and was corrected. Corrected catalogue/
  validation: **65 passed in 1.00 seconds**; control registry/report: **6 passed in 35.88 seconds**.
  Logs: /private/tmp/completeness-refusal-{first,expanded,final,corrected,registry}.log. All terminal.
  Coverage includes real PostgreSQL rollback, approval refusal, nested handling, migration head,
  downgrade protection and failure after evidence insert. Source Mypy, Ruff lint/format, generated
  OpenAPI, frontend tsc --noEmit and whitespace checks pass. npm run typecheck was unavailable;
  the direct TypeScript compiler check succeeded instead.
- Archived integration fallback evidence verbatim. Verified no open PRs and only remote main;
  continue tested direct-main publication. No deployment or full-suite/readiness claim. Remaining
  implementation, final release checks, engine cut/replays and independent accounting sign-off
  remain open; preserve publication exclusions and noncommercial licensing.

## Outstanding release verification

These checks need current release-candidate evidence. Historical October 3 results
remain in the dated build history; they do not verify current main. This list does
not authorize deployment, provisioning or changes to a live database.

- make audit-deps: passed on 87f53d1 October 7; rerun for the final release candidate.
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make docker-build
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make compose-verify
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make zap-baseline
- make tf-validate: passed on 40ae405 October 7 (validation only); rerun for final candidate.
- SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION NEEDED: make backup, make restore-verify (isolated local drill only)

## Older backend baseline completed — October 7, 2026

- PID 36126 is terminal and absent. The uninterrupted isolated run on revision 7c9b22d
  ended with **51 failed, 9,970 passed, 1 skipped, 640 deselected, 3 xfailed in 3h46m**.
  See docs/release/BACKEND-BASELINE-2026-10-07.md for the complete failure inventory and
  local evidence paths. No reset/restart occurred. This older run does not verify current main.
- Next: compare failures with current code, rerun scoped cases, and classify from evidence.
  Monetary import reconciliation and independent accounting sign-off remain outstanding.

## Policy approvals serialized with period locks — October 7, 2026

- Continued from PR #8 on main (`9c5556f`). Policy overrides do not append a contract event,
  so the existing event-appender period pin did not protect their approvals.
- Approval of an override on a non-draft contract now shares the close-window rows of all
  contracting/performing entities under tenant scope, after taking the group/contract locks and
  before publishing approval or supersession. Draft contracts have no frozen calculation and skip
  this control. The new scope entry is explicit in the architecture allowlist and developer guide.
- The pending-approvals gate ordinarily prevents a lock while a policy decision is outstanding.
  The regression uses the real **approved waiver** of that gate to exercise the permitted close
  path. When policy approval comes first, the lock waits, then refuses the committed dirty group.
  When the lock comes first, a later approval waits and can commit after it. When a lock overtakes
  an already-started policy decision, the stale approval is refused with `PERIOD_STATE_MOVED`;
  no approval audit or dirty mark is kept, the override remains submitted, and a retry succeeds.
- Counterfactual verification in an isolated test process bypassed only the new check: the stale
  policy decision returned **200 APPROVED** after the newer lock, where the regression requires
  409. With the check enabled, all three real PostgreSQL race cases passed. An earlier observation
  without a waiver proved lack of waiting but the ordinary pending gate still prevented locking;
  it is not evidence of a completed inconsistent lock.
- Actual verification: **26 policy and PostgreSQL window/race tests passed**, including the three
  new cases; **267 architecture tests passed**. Mypy passed both changed source files; Ruff
  lint/format and whitespace checks passed. These are targeted checks, not full-backend evidence.
- The economic treatment of FX classification transitions remains pending independent accounting
  review; public POL-163 authoring stays disabled. Repository completion only; no deployment.

## FX transition refusal and close-policy inputs — October 7, 2026

- PR #7 merged into main (`dc1c116`). Current work continues from that revision; no deployment.
- Added the missing functional-layer validation before a calculation can emit output. A fully
  consumed layer must carry zero; an open historical contract-liability layer must carry its
  remaining original historical basis. Positive and negative residues, partial releases and no
  release all refuse with the layer, period and expected/actual amounts identified.
- The reproduced monetary-to-historical defect is now blocked, **not implemented as a supported
  transition**. A PostgreSQL regression verifies the refused recomputation leaves the previous
  calculation head and journal lines intact and keeps the group dirty. Public POL-163 authoring
  remains disabled pending reviewed transition treatment and remaining approval/close validation.
- Close-run policy digests now include effective contract exceptions through the same period-scoped
  resolver used by bundles, under tenant scope. Drafts, same-value approvals, approvals after the
  entity-local period end and IFRS-forced treatment do not alter the digest. Existing digests are
  unchanged when no exception differs from the entity default.
- A real database close job records the old inputs, an effective approval makes its gate fail,
  and the next close job recomputes and records the new inputs. The prior period remains valid;
  the asset-position fixture needs no monetary adjustment or duplicate journal. Approval/lock
  concurrency still needs focused review; these tests do not certify the whole close workflow.
- Actual verification: **578 FX engine, posting, property and architecture tests passed**;
  **22 database and close-input unit tests passed**. Mypy passed both source files. Ruff lint,
  formatting and whitespace checks passed. No full-backend or production-readiness claim.
- Added `docs/release/ACCOUNTING-REVIEW.md` with the measured case, required decisions about
  correction versus a change in refund rights, economic timing, basis/rates and closed periods,
  and a pending independent-sign-off record. Reviewer identity was requested; no external contact
  or accounting sign-off occurred. This packet is not an approval.
- Earlier continuation entries were moved unchanged to the dated build history to keep this
  notebook below 20 KB. Publication exclusions and PolyForm Noncommercial licensing are retained.

## Public repository publication — October 5, 2026 (America/Los_Angeles)

- Owner requested public publication with commercial use prohibited. Prepared the supplied directory
  snapshot for `https://github.com/ChipmunkRPA/erev-cloud`, using PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.
- Updated LICENSE, NOTICE, bundled web copies, Python/npm package metadata, README and About dialog.
  Third-party notices remain intact. Previously granted MIT rights are not revoked.
- Excluded the entire `research-harness/` and `docs/research/` directories at the owner's explicit request; retained application
  source, fixtures, screenshots and documentation. See `docs/release/PUBLICATION-2026-10-05.md`.
- Actual validation: locked `npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`; AboutDialog vitest 4/4 passed;
  frontend Vite production build passed (existing large-chunk warning). `python3 scripts/secrets_check.py`:
  4,053 files scanned, 8 allow-listed, zero findings and zero unused entries before this note.
- Additional redacted Gitleaks scan reviewed: test constants, placeholder JWT, accounting identifiers
  and historical test references; research-harness findings removed with the entire directory.
  Targeted credential-pattern scan found only intentional self-test fixtures. These are targeted
  publication checks, not a full security audit. No generated dependencies or real environment/state
  files are staged.
- Backend/integration/accounting suites were not rerun for this licensing/publication change. Earlier
  results below remain historical. No deployment or cloud mutation; production/accounting blockers
  in LIMITS-1.0.md remain. Publication supersedes the earlier private-only instruction in this notebook.

### Publication correction — October 5, 2026

- Removed the entire research-harness and docs/research directories from the publication and replaced the initial root
  commit, so main has no ancestor containing those files. Used an exact force-with-lease against the
  previously verified remote commit. No application code changed; application tests were not rerun
  for this directory removal. External clones and GitHub cached/unreachable objects cannot be recalled
  by a branch rewrite alone.

### Public report website cleanup — October 5, 2026

- Scanned the repository for website references and reviewed documentation matches. Removed 155
  external website URLs plus bare domains across 12 documents and removed the design source
  bibliography. Kept explicit citation-removal markers, mandatory third-party notices, dependency
  metadata and operational endpoints. This does not revalidate the remaining historical prose.
- Follow-up documentation URL scan found only owner links, internal/example addresses and a local
  URL-validation regex. `git diff --check` passed. No application source changed; no application
  tests rerun. Replaced the public root with an exact force-with-lease against the verified head.

## Historical release record

The earlier build-loop notebook is preserved in
[BUILD-HISTORY-2026-10-07.md](docs/release/BUILD-HISTORY-2026-10-07.md).
Current outstanding implementation and verification gaps remain in
[the release limitations](docs/release/LIMITS-1.0.md).
